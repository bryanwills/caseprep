# Case-Prep Transcription — Docs Pack (v1.1)

This bundle contains:
- `blueprint.md` — full architecture, schemas, APIs, learning design, exports, UX, and roadmap.
- `decisions_and_guidance.md` — the choices we locked in.
- `deployment_scaling.md` — GPU/hybrid plans and security notes.
- `additional_options.md` — extra ideas and alternatives.
- `SECURITY_OVERVIEW.md` — privacy/encryption defaults and controls.

> Default posture: **no storage** unless the user opts in. Accuracy over speed. Self-host in dev; add GPU worker pool for production scale.
